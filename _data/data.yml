    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I graduated from computer engineering in 2017.My graduation degree is 2,96; currently doing a master's degree
      in computer science now, and currently my master's degree is 4.00. 
      I am interested in deep learning. My master thesis topic is 3d hyperspectral image classification. I finished coding
      part of the thesis. My career aim is comprehensive projects such as rocket science, defending industry, medical, and
      remote sensing. I am a ambitious person, but I am not impatient. I can work patiently to reach my aims and I can 
      easily devote myself for my projects. I can solve the problems about my works. I can immediately react against problems,
      errors and fails. In my off days, I look after some courses such as MIT, Standford and Harward and I watch video lectures
      of these kind of univerties videos. I need a opportunity for prove myself and doing good things for country.
